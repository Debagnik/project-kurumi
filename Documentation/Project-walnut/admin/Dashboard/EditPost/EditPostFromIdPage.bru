  GET /edit-post/:uniqueId
  
  Description:
    Retrieves the details of a specific post (identified by :UniqueId) for editing in the admin panel. This route allows the administrator to view the current content of a post and make changes to it. It checks for the user's authentication and renders an editing interface with the post's current data.
  
  Middleware Used:
    * authToken: Verifies the JWT token in the request. If the token is invalid or missing, the user is redirected to the /admin page.
  
  Access:
    * Private â€” This route is accessible only to authenticated users.
  
  Privilege-based Behavior:
    * The user must be authenticated, but no additional privileges are required to access this route.
  
  Request Parameters:
    - id: The ID of the post to be edited (URL parameter, required).
  
  Response:
    * Status 200: If the post is successfully retrieved, the post data is provided and the edit-post page is rendered with the current content.
    * Status 404: If the post with the specified :id does not exist in the database.
    * Status 500: Internal server error if an error occurs while retrieving the post.
  
  Notes:
    * Retrieves the post data by its unique ID from the database.
    * Renders the `admin/edit-post` template, which includes a form pre-filled with the post's current details (title, body, description, tags, and thumbnail image URI).
    * Includes CSRF protection in the form (using `csrfToken`).
    * The current user's privileges are checked to determine if they can approve or edit the post.
    * The template also includes an indication of whether the current user is a webmaster or has other relevant privileges.
  
  Example Request:
    * GET /edit-post/a_post_id_2298
